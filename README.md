# silver-train

A lightweight web "desktop" UI built with Next.js and TypeScript. silver-train provides a minimal, modular framework for creating a browser-based desktop experience with draggable app windows, a taskbar, start menu, and basic apps (calculator, notifications, etc.).

## Goal

This projects goal is to improve my personal skills in webdevelopment. Over the coarse of the development of this project, I am hoping to not only improve my designing skills, but also improve my ability to deliver a complete app. I want to add several different features in the future
